A Node.js http server that redirects example.com to www.example.com.

This service is deployed at [https://carnesen.com](https://carnesen.com). In a browser it won't be obvious, but notice how you end up at www.carnesen.com. In a terminal do `curl -v https://carnesen.com` to see the 301 redirect response.

## Usage
See [@carnesen/google-cloud](https://github.com/carnesen/google-cloud#usage) for an example of how I use this package.
