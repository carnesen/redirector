This service is deployed at [https://carnesen.com](https://carnesen.com). It's not easy to see in a browser (especially Google Chrome) because they often don't display the leading "www" on the URL. In a terminal though do:
```
curl -v https://carnesen.com
```
and notice the 301 redirect response to www.

## Usage
This package gets deployed by [**@carnesen/google-cloud**](https://github.com/carnesen/google-cloud#usage) as the default Google App Engine service.
